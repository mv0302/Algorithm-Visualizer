# Algorithm-Visualizer
Algorithms are a very important part of programming in general. They help in solving complex problems by breaking them into doable steps.These are extensively used in many areas and it is very important for students to understand their working clearly.Many students face difficulties in understanding the working of algorithms. This project aims at creating a visual of the algorithms so that it can be easy to visualize the algorithms. The array is represented in the form of a graph-like structure and the algorithm is represented through animations.
